# Full-Stack Learning Project

A simple full-stack project I built to explore and get hands-on experience with:

Backend:

-   **C#**
-   **Entity Framework Core**
-   **SQL Server**
-   **FluentAssertions**
-   **Scalar**

Frontend:

-   **Next.js**
-   **TailwindCSS**

This project was designed primarily as a learning experience to understand how to build modern web applications using a .NET backend and a Next.js frontend.

---

## Overview

The application is a simple to-do app that demonstrates:

-   Creating a REST API using ASP.NET Core
-   Managing data with Entity Framework Core
-   Building a responsive frontend with Next.js and TailwindCSS
-   Connecting the frontend and backend with API calls
-   Using Scalar to develop and test the APIs
-   Testing using FluentAssertions to write expressive testing code

---

## What I Learned

-   How to set up an ASP.NET Core Web API and structure backend code
-   Using Entity Framework Core for database modeling and migrations
-   Creating a Next.js frontend and styling with TailwindCSS
-   Making HTTP requests and handling client-server communication
-   Using Scalar to develop and test the API Endpoints
-   Writing unit test code with FlentAssertion
-   MS Visual Studio's Analyze Code Coverage to improve the testing code

## Getting Started

Follow the README within the frontend and backend folders for the get started guides (Ensure the Backend servers are runnning first before the frontend servers).
